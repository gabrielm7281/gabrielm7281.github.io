            <h1 class="margin text-center">CYOA Project</h1>
            <p>Me and another student created an interactive adventure using links and different files</p>
            <h4>Context of This Project</h4>
            <p>For the CYOA Project, we were practicing linking between files and collaborating with others. We practiced linking files to each other last semester but it wasnt anything very extensive. In this project, we were able to link to multiple different files to create your own choices and path. We did this by making 2 different file paths which both had individual endings, going from getting your dream job to dying after an accident.
                <br>
            <br>There were 2 people involved in this project, me and William Li. Since we were required to collaborate there had to be a lot of communication between us which was a little hard since I was away for the entire week that we were working on it. He used Slack to guide me on what I should be doing and I followed the directions later and fixed any mistakes that either of us have made, even if it was on seperate things. To avoid any issues we decided to work on completley different things which helped speed up the process and make communication between us easier.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h4>What Was Required?</h4>
            <p>Since we decided to use HTML files instead of regular Markdown files, we were able to do a lot more with custimization. The bare minimum for the project was to create 10 files and have access to all of them through choices(Links) the user chose. We also used some CSS to make sure that the pages looked intresting and felt friendly to the user instead of having boring and plain text.</p>



            <br><h4>Challenges and Takeaways</h4>
            <p> I think the biggest challenge that we had was our communication. Neither of us were able to talk to each other very much so we couldnt help each other when we needed it. We would have to wait until the next day since I was usually working at a later time than everyone else. Even though this was a big setback I think it was still pretty easy to do what I needed to do because of the projects simplicity. There were some CSS elements but William took care of all of that. I was a little hesitant to mess with it since I dont know what he wanted but I tried to make all the pages look a little nicer and cleaner` </p>
            <p> I noticed that being confident in what I was doing was a little harder because of the lack of communication. I had no idea what William wanted outside of the plan and the bit that he texted to me on Slack so I had to do my own thing even if it wasnt exactly what he expected. I think communication is very important when working in projects even on your own, so you know exactly what to do or what is acceptable in the space you are working in.</p>
