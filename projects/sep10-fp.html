            <h1 class="margin text-center">SEP 10 Freedom Project</h1>
            <h4>What Was Asked from Us?</h4>
            <p>The SEP10 Freedom Project was a year long assignment, where we had to design a website that showcased items in a certain field/industry (Part A), as well as an idea that we came up with that would improve the industry. There was also a big focus on the code that we learned, and this project allowed us to put together everything we learned over the year into one spot using both basic HTML/CSS and a framework that we chose.</p>

            <p>For the project, I wanted to do <b>Aviation</b>. I decided to pick this topic because I am really intrested in planes and already knew a lot about them, so it was an easy way to start off. For the project, we were supposed to show off current and previous technologies that were signifigant in the field in the Part-A section. Some examples that I used were Fly-By-Wire systems and radars that many pilots use. The next part of the project was the Part-B section whhere I had to design a product that solved a problem that the field was having. I chose to make a new plane that was made to get small remote communities to the outside world, and its purpose/abilities are explained further below.
                <ul>
                <b>Pros</b>
                    <li>Can take off from nearly anywhere in the world because of its tough build</li>
                    <li>Takes high amounts of cargo for its size so that people can carry more to support their community</li>
                    <li>Very cheap to build and maintain so its affordable to millions around the world</li>
                </ul>
                <hr>
                <ul>
                <b>Cons</b>
                    <li>You have to attach parts to it yourself (Wings to fuselage, wheels to their bays) or pay to have it fully assembled</li>
                    <li>Heavy cargo may affect its performance and range</li>
                    <li>If there are major problems it can be quite hard to fix it without proper support and parts</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Problems I Faced</h4>
            <p>Making the website was a very long process. We first started off by learning what we could do with our frameworks (People were able to choose different ones) and that took a few weeks. I learned Foundation, which has a very good system for making the website responsive. Since it was fairly close to Bootstrap, which we learned as a class, it was easy for me to get used to the program and make small tweaks to the templates that they had on their website. However, once I got to work on the project, I realized that I needed to use their responsive system instead of Bootstraps, system. I had only used the Foundation components so far and this slowed me down since I had to quickly learn how to use it. Thankfully, I was able to use their documentation and videos to learn how to use it. The responsive system was fairly simple and needed a lot less effort than regular CSS responsiveness which was really nice for me. It isnt purpose built to have perfect responsiveness like CSS Grid does, but it works well.</p>
            <p>The step after learning the framework was to create a wireframe to guide our ideas in the layout of the website. This was the visual blueprint of what we had in our head and it helped us go through the process a lot faster. We made individual wireframes for a computer screen and a phone screen, with slightly different layouts so that it would fit and look good at the same time. For Part A, I provided some background information about Aviation, and on a computer it is shown in a box. However, if you look at it on your phone it shows up as an accordion. I did this so that you wouldnt have to scroll to get to the main parts of the project instead of going through the context first. This was a huge challenge for me because Accordions were something I struggled with, even in Bootstrap. The Foundation accordion snippet was large and had a lot of different things going on. It also needed a JQuery CDN so that its expand/contract feature could work. That wasnt labeled clearly but it was evntually figured out. Since I put that in at the very end of the project, there wasnt enough time to make it perfect, and I wasnt able to color it the way I wanted to, or include other cosmetic features that are found around the site.</p>
